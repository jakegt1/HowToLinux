# 03_Scripting

So, let's get our environment ready for scripting.

if you're not already, use `cd` to get to your HOME directory. You can use either:

```bash
cd ~
cd "$HOME"
```

Now, we'll make a directory for our work. Let's call it `projects`:

```bash
jakegt1@soulcatcher:~$ mkdir projects
jakegt1@soulcatcher:~$ cd ./projects/ # ./ - current directory
jakegt1@soulcatcher:~/projects$
```
